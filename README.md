A filtering implementation for verifying correct data and performing typical modifications to arrays

## Requirements

Requires PHP 7.0 or newer and uses composer to install further PHP dependencies.  See the [composer specification](composer.json) for more details.

## Installation

filter-arrays-php can be installed for use in your project using [composer](http://getcomposer.org).
The recommended way of using this library in your project is to add a `composer.json` file to your project.  The following contents would add filter-arrays-php as a dependency:
```sh
composer require traderinteractive/filter-arrays
```

## Included Filters

#### Arrays::copy
This filter will copy values from the input array into the resulting array using the destination key map.
```php
$input = ['foo' => 1, 'bar' => 2];
$keyMap = ['FOO_VALUE' => 'foo', 'BAR_VALUE' => 'bar'];
$result = \TraderInteractive\Filter\Arrays::copy($input, $keyMap);
assert($result === ['FOO_VALUE' => 1, 'BAR_VALUE' => 2]);
```

#### Arrays::copyEach
This filter will copy values from each array within the input array into the resulting array using the destination key map.
```php
$input = [
    ['foo' => 1, 'bar' => 2],
    ['foo' => 3, 'bar' => 4],
];
$keyMap = ['FOO_VALUE' => 'foo', 'BAR_VALUE' => 'bar'];
$result = \TraderInteractive\Filter\Arrays::copyEach($input, $keyMap);
assert($result === [['FOO_VALUE' => 1, 'BAR_VALUE' => 2], ['FOO_VALUE' => 3, 'BAR_VALUE' => 4]]);
```
#### Arrays::in
This filter is a wrapper around `in_array` including support for strict equality testing.

The following does a strict check for `$value` against the 3 accepted values.
```php
\TraderInteractive\Filter\Arrays::in($value, ['a', 'b', 'c']);
```

#### Arrays::filter

This filter verifies that the argument is an array and checks the length of the array against bounds.  The
default bounds are 1+, so an empty array fails by default.

The following checks that the `$value` is an array with exactly 3 elements.
```php
\TraderInteractive\Filter\Arrays::filter($value, 3, 3);
```

#### Arrays::flatten

This filter flattens a multi-dimensional array to a single dimension.  The order of values will be
maintained, but the keys themselves will not.  For example:
```php
$value = \TraderInteractive\Filter\Arrays::flatten([[1, 2], [3, [4, 5]]]);
assert($value === [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
```

## Project Build
